LA.py : library to import

runLA.py : execution of functions imported from LA.py

In LA.py, there are implementations of 

1. upperTri : It uses Gaussian Elimination to transform a matrix to its row echelon form, becoming an upper triangular matrix.

2. rref : function of reduced row echelon form that keep the pivot to be one and eliminate other entry in the that pivot column.

3. det : It computes the determinant of a matrix

4. inv : It derives the inverse of a matrix

5. solve : It can solve the simultaneous problem


List of functions to be done

1. spectrum decomposition : derive the eigenvalues and eigenvectors  of a matrix

2. SVD : single value decomposition
